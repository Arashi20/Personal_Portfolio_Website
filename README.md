# Arash Personal Portfolio Website

In this repository I will be working on my personal portfolio website. On this website I will list down my recent projects and skills obtained. Moreover, you can get a quick summary of my educational as well as professional background through my CV and other links. 


### Tech Stack

I decided to work with the following tech stack:
- Flask for the backend
- HTML + CSS for the frontend

I picked these specifically as i already have experience with using them in my previous projects, and for the scope of this website the tech stack is sufficient.
