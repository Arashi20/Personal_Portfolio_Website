# Welcome to my Blog!

You are currently witnessing the first blog post on my personal portfolio website! It took me a while to settle on what design I wanted to go for and adding in all the MVP functionalities, but the final product is very much to my liking. 



## Why I built this

I wanted to build a personal portfolio website for several reasons, namely:

- Keeping my projects and learning trajectory visible to myself, as well as to recruiters/enthusiasts around the world
- Having a more interactive extension to my CV
- Simply because I like to build nice and useful tools and really challenge myself,  as it gives me a sense of satisfaction 



## How I built it

For the tech stack, I used:

- **Flask** for the backend to keep things lightweight and flexible.
- **HTML/CSS (with some custom styles)** for a simple yet aesthetic interface.
- All posts are written in Markdown for ease of writing and are rendered into HTML using the `safe` filter in Jinja2.
- Deployment was done using Railway.

This process pushed me to solidify my knowledge of web apps, routing, templates, and deploying production-ready tools.


## What's next?

There’s plenty more to come! Some ideas include:

- Regular posts on my data science/AI projects.
- Feature refinements on pages, such as the projects page and CV page.

Stay tuned and thanks for reading!
