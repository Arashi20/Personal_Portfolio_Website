        <!-- 1. A brief introduction about yourself -->
            I specialize in building <strong>scalable AI systems</strong> and visualizing complex data. 
            My background in Cognitive Science helps me bridge the gap between 
            human intuition and machine learning models.
        </p>

        <!-- Aspiration -->
        <p>
            I believe that becoming an impactful Data Scientist starts with a strong foundation in 
            <strong>Data Analysis</strong> and <strong>Engineering</strong>. While I enjoy building 
            software tools to sharpen my skills, my professional focus is on extracting meaningful 
            insights and constructing the robust data pipelines that make advanced AI possible.
        </p>
        <!-- Cross-cultural and interdisciplinary approach  -->
        <p>
            Having studied Cognitive Science & Artificial Intelligence at <strong>Tilburg University</strong>, a degree that attracted students from all over the world, I bring a cross-cultural perspective 
            to my work. Moreover, my <strong>interdisciplinary</strong> education allows me to approach problems from multiple angles, 
            combining technical expertise with an understanding of human behavior.
        </p>

        <!-- Hobbies -->
        <p>
            When I'm not coding, you can find me analyzing stocks, reading greek mythology, or lifting weights at the gym.
